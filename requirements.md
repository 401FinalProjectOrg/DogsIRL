# Software Requirements

## Vision
Here at Dog IRL we believe pets should have an online presence and ability to meet and make new friends. People love showing off their adorable pets and with Dog IRL now they have a social media outlet that allows them to do so. With this app your pets can meet new friends and collect their `id cards` to show how all the pets are connected.

## Scope
### In
This web app will allow users to create profiles for their dogs
The app will allow pets to virtually interact with each other
Pets will be able to collect the id cards of fellow pets once they have interacted
Pets will be able to have short text dialogue

### Out
Our web app will never sell the data of our users.

## MVP
	A website that allows logging in, creating a profile for your pet, and interacting with other pets.
